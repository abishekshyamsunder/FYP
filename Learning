Composition function: It is a method for combining multiple words into a single vector, it is the heart of any word embedding system.
There are two types of compostion functions, 
	Unordered: Treat input texts as bags of word embeddings
	Syntactic: Take word and sentece structure into account
The tradeoff between the 2 is that, the second one needs more training and resources
The DAN model works in three simple steps, 
	step1: Take the vector average associated with the input sentece tokens
	step2: Pass output of step1 through a series of feed forward networks 
	step3: Perform linear classification
